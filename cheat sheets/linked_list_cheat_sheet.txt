Linked List Cheat Sheet

Key Operations:
- Access: O(n)
- Insertion (beginning): O(1)
- Insertion (end): O(n) (singly linked), O(1) (doubly linked)
- Deletion (beginning): O(1)
- Deletion (end): O(n) (singly linked), O(1) (doubly linked)
- Search: O(n)

Common Use Cases:
- Implementing stacks and queues.
- Dynamic memory allocation.
- Representing polynomial expressions.

Notes:
- Linked lists have non-contiguous memory allocation.
- Singly linked lists have pointers to the next node.
- Doubly linked lists have pointers to the next and previous nodes.
