Array Cheat Sheet

Key Operations:
- Access: O(1)
- Insertion (end): O(1) (amortized)
- Insertion (beginning/middle): O(n)
- Deletion (end): O(1)
- Deletion (beginning/middle): O(n)
- Search: O(n) (unsorted), O(log n) (sorted, binary search)

Common Use Cases:
- Storing a fixed-size collection of elements.
- Implementing stacks and queues.
- Matrix operations.

Notes:
- Arrays have contiguous memory allocation.
- Dynamic arrays (like vectors) handle resizing automatically.
