Sorting Cheat Sheet

Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort: O(n^2)
- Insertion Sort: O(n^2)
- Selection Sort: O(n^2)
- Merge Sort: O(n log n)
- Quick Sort: O(n log n) (average), O(n^2) (worst)
- Heap Sort: O(n log n)

Common Use Cases:
- Ordering data for efficient searching.
- Data preprocessing.
- Implementing priority queues (heap sort).

Notes:
- Merge sort and heap sort have guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity.
- Quick sort is often faster in practice but has a worst-case O(n^2).
