Graph Cheat Sheet

Key Operations:
- Add Vertex: O(1)
- Add Edge: O(1) (adjacency list), O(V^2) (adjacency matrix)
- DFS: O(V + E)
- BFS: O(V + E)

Common Use Cases:
- Representing networks.
- Social network analysis.
- Pathfinding algorithms.

Notes:
- Adjacency lists are efficient for sparse graphs.
- Adjacency matrices are efficient for dense graphs.
- V = number of vertices, E = number of edges.
